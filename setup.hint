sdesc: "Game where you build molecules out of single atoms"
ldesc: "Atomix is a little mind game where you have to build molecules out of
single atoms. These are laying around between the walls and obstacles on
the playfield. Once you have pushed an atom in one direction it moves
until it hits an obstacle or another atom. It needs some thinking how to
construct complex molecules with this atom behaviour. The game is
inspired by the original Amiga version."
